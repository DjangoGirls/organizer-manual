# Conference partnerships

One of the ways to boost your event is by partnering with conferences in your city (or neighboring cities!). This section contains some (hopefully) helpful tips and guidelines that you can use when you communicate and operate with a conference.

When you first approach a conference, assuming that they're interested, you can bring up any of the standard sponsorship requests as you would with any sponsor. However, there are a few unique areas where conferences can be a great source of support, more so than other types of sponsors.


## Conference tickets

Some conferences can be very expensive, others are free. If you can arrange for free entrance to the conference for participants, great! Discount? Still good! Just crunch the numbers and see if you can make up the difference with sponsorship funds.

## Space for the workshop

If the conference is longer than 2-3 days (for example, EuroPython is 5 days + 2 sprint days), you might be able to get access to a room during the first day of the conference. Otherwise, the conference might be able to help you reserve space at/near the venue on the day before the conference begins. 

This will help familiarize the participants with the venue, and if you time your breaks to coincide with the conference schedule, the participants will be able to mingle with conference attendees from the start! 

## Financial aid 

More and more conferences are kicking off diversity activities, scholarships, mentoring programs, and more. If you aim for international attendance, you could approach the conference for help with travel funds and accommodation. 

For example, many conferences already have room blocks or discounts at hotels, and might also be able to directly sponsor the rooms (or arrange for an invoice that another sponsor can pay directly to the hotel).

## Swag and food

If you are partnering with a conference that already has a few hundred attendees, they should be able to arrange for a few dozen shirts, bags, nametags, lunch spots, etc. You can also ask to be connected with the conference sponsors for further support.

Note: coach shirts are better arranged separately, because then you can have control over the design, but shirts or nametags for participants that bear the conference logo are a great way to help the participants feel like they are a part of the bigger event, and it's not out of your workshop budget.

## Cross-promotion and online traction

Conferences normally have a large-to-huge mailing list, countless followers on Twitter, and a [social media strategist](http://elitedaily.com/envision/these-20-photos-prove-that-you-take-your-job-title-way-too-seriously-photos/651099/). You can therefore leverage their online presence to call out for coaches, sponsors, or even participants (as in "tell your women friends about us so they can come to the conference too!").

## Lightning talks 

If you can secure a Django Girls lightning talk, they're a great way to introduce conference attendees to the project and broadcast a call to action. Check out the resources repository on GitHub for presentation templates!

## Sprint/hackfest

A sprint/hackfest is a great way to give participants the space to continue to work on their websites, extend it, edit the tutorial, or simply learn more Django or Python! 

If the conference is Python/Django-focused, you can probably join an existing sprint room where core developers are already working. Otherwise, you can announce the sprint/hackfest as a general Django/Python event and invite core developers or other interested parties who want to learn or work on Python/Django. 

## Table/booth

Attending your first tech conference can be scary, even when you're not an absolute beginner! A well-placed booth will give the workshop participants a "home base", where they can return to if they feel lost. Having a booth also gives a chance for the participants (new graduates!) to act as subject matter experts, as conference attendees tend to walk up and ask questions. 

Some tips and suggestions for a successful booth:

### Logistics

* The booth should be operated by at least 1 coach/organizer and 1-2 participants, so that attendees can learn about the different perspectives of the project. The easiest way to set this up is to create a Doodle with timeslots for each "shift", and ask participants to "vote" for the times that they can attend.
* Write down and pay special attention to all the peak times at the booth, such as lunch, coffee breaks, breakfast, and make sure that the core organizers are present during those times.
* Make sure that the conference provides you with at least 1-2 power adapters/extension cords, as conferences do not always provide these! Optional: Arrange for a computer monitor where you can run a slideshow of previous Django Girls workshop photos, demo the tutorial in action, etc.


### Decorations

Decorations for the booth are up to you and are super-important to drive traffic to your booth! Here are some options/suggestions based on past DG booths:

* Printed tablecloths
* LED lightstrips (that you can control with a Raspberry Pi!) 
* [Brown packing paper](http://www.amazon.co.uk/750mm-Heavy-Brown-Kraft-Wrapping/dp/B00684AYTY/) + [white/black/gold markers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BSR8OFC) and someone with nice handwriting
* [Gold balloons](http://www.ebay.com/itm/16-40-Gold-Silver-Foil-Letter-Number-Balloons-Birthday-Wedding-Party-Decoration-/141467803149?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&var=440617724363&hash=item20f0235e0d)
* Flowers in pots, or if you can't get pots, use old cans + gold spray paint!
* Workshop poster with the sponsor logos (you can just move the posters that you printed for the workshop and hang them on the walls or on boards).

### Swag

* When you order swag for the workshop, choose a few key cheap items (like pens, buttons, or stickers) and order double/triple/etc so that you have enough to give away at the conference. 
* More expensive items such as tote bags or shirts can be sold at the booth for donations. Make sure to get a tip jar for cash, and also some form of online payment such as bigcartel.com or tictail.com, for people who want to pay with their credit cards.
* Print little cards/flyers with links to the organizer manual, coaching manual, email to hello@djangogirls.org, to give out to people who want to organize or coach future workshops.
* If you're planning to sell swag, you can use [mini-blackboard signs](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hot-Sales-Mini-Small-Wood-Blackboard-Wedding-Buffet-Blackboards-Chalkboards-/351214608057?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item51c6059eb9) to highlight the price.
* Make sure you have a plan for what to do with cash income from swag. If the conference organizers can help store it for you or deposit it in the conference account and then transfer it to the DG account, it'll reduce stress of wandering around with wads of money!
* Try to think of a useful way to utilize the funds from swag sales. For example, if you're planning a follow-up workshop, you can keep the funds for that, or you can help out another workshop that's running into sponsorship trouble.

### Promotion

* Try to have someone on social media duty at the booth, and post lots of pictures! If people are tweeting from their personal accounts, try to have them tag the workshop account.
* Memorize/prepare a 30 sec - 1 min [elevator pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) about Django Girls, as you'll have lots of people asking about what we do and most of the booth time will be spent on these types of introductions.

### Warnings

* Do not leave the booth unattended! Depending on the conference, you might be able to leave basic swag overnight, but anything that is worth money like swag for sale, monitors, and tip jar (with money of course) must be either watched by someone at the booth or taken with you when you leave.
* Don't waste money on foody swag, and don't be tempted to give away shirts or bags. Unlike the big corporations, we are operating independently and on a donation basis, and conferences provide enough food to all attendies that we don't need to supplement it!
* Don't let people leave their bags, jackets, or laptops in the booth unless they are on shift and can fit their items under the table or somewhere hidden. You might end up with a closet more than a booth!
* Keep the table tidy! Cups, cans, bottles, unfinished food... They look a mess and clutter the table.

To add a sponsors, go at the bottom of this page and look if your sponsor isn't already in the drop down menu. If it's the case, select it and click on `Add another Eventpagecontent-Sponsor Relationship`. If your sponsor isn't in the menu, click on the `plus` button and a new window will open:

* Add the name of the sponsor.
* Choose a picture from your computer with a sponsor's logo. Make sure it is not too big or too small. You can leave this field empty - in this case the name of the sponsor will be displayed instead of the picture.
* Add the website address of the sponsor.
* You can add some extra description, but we usually leave it empty.
* Click on save.
* Add as many sponsors as you want by clicking on `Add another Eventpagecontent-Sponsor Relationship`.
* Don't forget to save your modifications by clicking on the `save` blue button on the right.

Once your event is done, you won't be able to edit any of those fields. If you need to do that, please send us an [email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.com).

# When you're ready!

To make your website available to everyone, click on `Events` in the left menu. Go to `Website` and click on your website in the list. You'll obtain this:

The most important thing here is the `Is live` checkbox. When your website is ready, click on it and save your page. Tada: your website is now online!

Remember that you don't need to make it "live" to test your website: as an administrator of your website, you'll always be able to access it.

# Order a Workshop box

To help you reduce the cost of your event, we created a `Workshop box` full of stickers, name tags, badges and balloons. To order it, [go to our store](https://store.djangogirls.org/products/django-girls-workshop-box).

If your event is taking place in a [developing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country) or if you tried but can't find sponsors for your event, you'll be able to apply for a free box. Here are the requirements to be able to apply for a free box:

* You need to have a venue for your workshop
* Application process for your event needs to already be open
* You need to order it at least 6 weeks before workshop to allow for shipping time

When you meet all those requirements, [send us an email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org).

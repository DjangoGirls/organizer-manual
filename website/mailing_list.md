# Create a mailing list

Creating a mailing list is a good way to keep potential attendees and coaches informed about your event. We recommend you to do this if you want to launch your website but can't announce registrations or event dates yet.

To create a mailing list:

* Go to [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) and create a free account.
* Create a list.
* Click on your list in the `lists` tab.
* Click on `Signup forms` and `Embedded form`.
* Edit your form and copy the code.
* Go back to your admin interface in Django Girls website.
* Click on `Events` in the left menu.
* Got to `Website Contents`.
* Click on the name of the section where you want your form to appear.
* Past the code in the `Content` section and save your modifications!

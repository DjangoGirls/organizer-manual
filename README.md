# Django Girls Organizer's Manual

If you are reading it, that means you are interested in organizing your own Django Girls event. That's awesome!

In this manual we're going to explain you how it works, what you need to do and how to get started. So... let's get into details:

## What is Django Girls?

Django Girls is an initiative that is aiming to introduce women who never code before to the world of technology and increase the diversity of the industry.

We do that by organizing workshops and inviting women to join us and learn how to build the internet using HTML, CSS, Python and Django in a safe, friendly, inclusive environment.

Our mission is to bring more women into tech field, by making technology more approachable, simple and friendly. We give tools, resources and community that that makes it easier to learn about technology.

## The Basics

### What is a Django Girls event?

Django Girls event is a one-day workshop + installation party done in the evening before or remotely via Google Hangout / Skype. During the whole day participants work in small groups (3 attendees + 1 coach) and go through tutorial to successfully create a blog application and deploy it to the Internet.

Django Girls events are always non-profit, free for participants. We do not pay coaches, speakers or organizers. Attendees don't need any previous knowledge about programming and there are no age-limitations. All the attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity.

### Philosophy

- __Attendee's experience matters__. When you're learning something new, it's common to get lost or discouraged because it's hard. That's why the learning experience, helpful and friendly environment matters a lot. Make sure they feel like a little children in Disneyland, excited to go on adventure. It's all in the big little details.
- __Everyone can do it__. Technology is for people and everyone can be a creator. Show the bigger picture and encourage them to try new things.
- __It's all about the people__. People are the core of what we do. We create events that we would want to attend ourselves. Think about their experience, help them, be welcoming and make sure no one is lost. Be helpful and proactive. Smile, ask questions, make them feel awesome.

# Accessibility 

We want to make all Django Girls events as accessible as possible. Making your
event accessible will help everyone, not just attendees with disabilities. This 
page can be daunting because we are trying to be comprehensive, but read through 
it and do your best! 

Depending on your venue, you might not be able to do all of these things. But if you 
think about accessibility from the time you decide to organize an event, you
have a better chance of not accidentally leaving groups of people out. So 
here are a few things to consider with respect to accessibility when organizing 
your event. 

### Venue 

Before you decide on a venue, try to do a walkthrough to determine which parts
of the venue you'll be using, based on access. Find out what accommodations, if 
any, the venue provides. It might take some pressure off you, and will also give 
you an idea of what is not available. 

- Are there any rooms you can use as quiet/lactation rooms? Quiet rooms should be 
quiet and calm, so that folks can use them to escape noise and bright lights, and 
also comfortably use them for pumping breast milk. 
- How compliant is your venue with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or similar
laws in your country? Is it braille and signage compliant? Are there accessible 
routes to all parts of the venue? 
- What is the temperature differential between outside and inside? Does it tend to be
chilly or warm? If you know this, you can warn people to bring a sweater (or not 
wear heavy clothes).
- Is the floor carpeted? Is the carpet firm? How easy would it be to move a wheelchair 
or walker across the floor?
- If the floor isn't carpeted, is it slippery? 
- Is the venue noisy or echo-y? If your venue is a hotel, will there be music in the lobby? 
Will your attendees be able to work in quiet? 
- Are service animals welcome? Are there grassy areas for them? 
- What do the entrances look like? Is the main entrance wheelchair accessible? 
- Are there ramps with handrails? 
- Are the restrooms accessible? Do they have grab bars and lowered sinks? Are there 
gender-neutral restrooms that are trans-inclusive? 
- Is there accessible parking? 
- Is there adequate lighting for your attendees to work? 
- Is the venue allergy-free and scent-free?  Consider creating a [scent policy](https://portland.adacamp.org/policies/#scent) and asking  attendees to not wear perfume to the event, 
for folks who have allergies, asthma, or are prone to migraines. 

### Blind or low vision attendees 

To welcome attendees with blind or low vision, first speak to your coaches. Someone coaching an 
attendee with low vision should first and foremost be flexible. An attendee with low vision
may already have a screen reader set up on their machine that they are used to, so
the installation party is a great opportunity for a coach to get to know this attendee's setup. 

Not all attendees who have low vision are blind, so make sure that any presenters giving lightning 
talks are using a large font on their screen. (Remember that code in particular can be hard to read 
on a PowerPoint.) Ask your presenters to prepare handouts in a large font. (If your coaches are giving talks, ask them to give you a digital file in advance so you can make copies beforehand; ideally, coaches shouldn't be out money to participate in your workshop!) Ask your 
presenters to also remember to verbally describe any images that are in their presentations. 

Make sure the web site and materials you prepare for the workshop pass the [Web AIM Contrast Checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). 
Just feed in the hex code of the background color and the font color, and this free tool will let you 
know if your contrast is sufficient. 

Code in particular can be hard to see for anybody. The font tends to be small and not double-spaced, 
so if you're doing any demonstrations on a large screen, make sure your font is very large. Finding 
where to enlarge the type on the command line or in a text editor can also be hard, so have your coaches
walk your attendees through that. It will make it easier for them to read and debug. 

### Hard of hearing or Deaf attendees

Again, working with attendees who are hard of hearing will go best with a flexible coach. Speak to your 
coaches about using text-based communication (chat, whiteboard) during the tutorial for attendees who are Deaf or hard of hearing. Remind coaches to look at their attendees when speaking to them, as there may 
be people who read lips. Also, find out if any of your attendees will be bringing interpreters; you 
will want to provide them with food and a space to sit!

Ask your presenters to speak slowly and clearly (sometimes people speak more quickly when they get 
nervous!), and remind them to either provide a script or a handout for their presentation. 

Remember that being hard of hearing doesn't always mean total hearing loss. People who are Deaf, hard 
of hearing, find it hard to concentrate in loud rooms, or for whom English (or whatever language your 
workshop is in) is not their first language can all benefit from these tips. 

### Web site and application 

Don't make your attendees ask which accommodations you're able to provide. Be up front about what you're 
able to do! This will encourage people who need those accommodations to apply, since they will be 
confident that they can participate in your event. Being specific with your list of accommodations 
will show potential attendees that you're working to create a space where access and inclusivity are 
priorities. You can just add these as questions in your FAQ section. See [this event](http://djangogirls.org/portland) for some suggestions. 

Ask for suggestions from your coaches and attendees on other things you might want to provide. For example, 
maybe you can find a friend to volunteer time for child care.

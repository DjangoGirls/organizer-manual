# FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions 

Django Girls events have been happening all over the world for awhile now, and we get some repeat questions. Hopefully this page will help you if part of the planning process has you confused! 

**Q: Isn't Django Girls sexist?**

A: It really isn't, but we can understand why people might feel that way. 
We've found that by having a women-only space for learning Python and Django, 
women are more comfortable participating. See 
[this essay](http://jennifermann.ghost.io/minority-groups-in-tech-is-it-just-reverse-sexism/) 
on "[reverse sexism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Reverse_sexism)" and 
Rails Girls to see what we mean. If you're having the knee-jerk reaction that 
reaching out specifically to women hurts men, or hurts diversity efforts in 
other areas, we encourage you to read 
[How I Stopped Worrying and Started Loving Pyladies](https://hynek.me/articles/how-i-stopped-worrying-and-started-loving-pyladies/) 
by Hynek Schlawack. One particularly relevant quote is this: 

> Outreach programs don’t divide our community. They incubate people which 
aren’t comfortable to cope with us from the beginning on and grow our community 
in the long term.

> It doesn’t really matter whose fault the initial discomfort is. Whether 
they’re being over-sensitive (hint: [they aren’t](http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/mar/21/lighten-up/)) 
or whether we’re a bunch of a**holes (I know you aren’t). The facts are these: 
if we want underrepresented people to enrich our community, we have to look for 
pragmatic ways to get them in. Even if the methods don’t seem sound to us on the 
first sight to us.

> “Yes, but…” discussion don’t help. PyLadies – and similar outreach groups – 
found a way that works. So be thankful to their organizers for doing this! And 
again: if you know of a better way, stop sh*tting on their approach and go for 
it! The world isn’t binary; the more approaches, the more diversity, the better.

Also, not all Django Girls events are exclusive to women. Our organizer's manual 
encourages organizers to use our materials to put on workshops for women *and* 
for mixed-gender groups. We've also open-sourced all of our content, so if you 
like our tutorial but don't want to put on a Django Girls event with it, feel 
free to fork it, credit us for the content, but rebrand it into something that 
works for your goals.  

We don't want to get men *out* of programming; we just want to bring more women 
*in*. There are already a lot of other bootcamps, workshops, meetups, and groups 
that are "mixed gender," but are really mostly men. We've found that by limiting 
our workshop to a majority of women participants, women are more comfortable 
signing up, asking questions, getting involved, and even staying involved later 
on. And that's a good thing!

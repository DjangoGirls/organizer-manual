# Cloud Development vs Local Installation
For a while, one of the major issues we have got as feedback from organizers after the workshop was that
the tutorial was too long and could be shortened if the participants do not have to go through the installation
bit. One of the workshops made participants develop in the cloud and made the participants experience better as
they were able to move forward with the workshop faster as they skipped the installation.

We have come up with a solution to help standardise cloud development for workshops who do want to skip the 
installation steps and jump right into the coding bits of the tutorial through a partnership with 
[RunCode.io](https://runcode.io/). You can use the [RunCode](https://runcode.io/) Cloud Development for your
workshop. 

Try to practice using the platform by following the tutorial using the [RunCode](https://runcode.io/) platform to 
familiarize yourself with the platform. If you need help using [RunCode](https://runcode.io/) within the workshop, 
please ask for help from the developers by reaching out to kalyani@runcode.io and ashwin@runcode.io, and they will 
do a demo for you, help you out with free credits or any support required.

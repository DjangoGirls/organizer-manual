# Cloud Development vs Local Installation
For a while, one of the major issues we have got as feedback from organizers after the workshop was that
the tutorial was too long and could be shortened if the participants do not have to go through the installation
bit. One of the events, gave us feedback that they made participants do cloud development and it greatly 
improved the participants' experience. The attendees were able to move forward with the workshop faster as they
skipped the installation.

We have come up with a solution to help standardise cloud development for workshops who do want to skip the 
installation steps and jump right into the coding bits of the tutorial through a partnership with 
[RunCode.io](https://runcode.io/). You can use the [RunCode](https://runcode.io/) Cloud Development for your
workshop. 

> **Note**: You need to have stable internet for this setup. If you can't provide participants with
stable internet, then it may be better to do the local installation.

If you do take this route, try to practice using the platform by following the tutorial using the 
[RunCode](https://runcode.io/) platform to familiarize yourself with the platform. If you need help using 
[RunCode](https://runcode.io/) within the workshop, please ask for help from the developers by reaching out to 
kalyani@runcode.io and ashwin@runcode.io, and they will do a demo for you, help you out with free credits or any 
support required.

The participants can always do the installation as homework later.

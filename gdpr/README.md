# GDPR and Data Privacy Compliance

[A Developer’s Guide to GDPR that won’t make you sweat](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/a-developers-guide-to-gdpr-that-won-t-make-you-sweat-4f1f7f1d9c8b) by [Mags Allen

> More reading on how we handle GDPR as Django 
Girls Foundation can be found on our website's
 [Terms and Conditions](https://djangogirls.org/terms-conditions/)
 and [Cookie and Privacy Policy](https://djangogirls.org/privacy-cookies/) 
 sections.

**The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a
 set of rules that came into effect on May 25th, 2018.** 
 
It regulates the use of data by organisations.
It applies to any organisation that stores or processes
 any data relating to individuals inside the European 
 Union (EU). 
 
 Since we have events in Europe, it is important 
 for Django Girls Foundation and organizers across 
 the globe to comply with GDPR as it has legal 
 implications. All organizers should therefore 
 comply with GDPR as it protects users' data, 
 irrespective of their location. 
 
 This guide therefore applies to all organizers 
 as they deal with the sensitive data of fellow 
 organizers, attendees and sometimes, sponsors 
 from the EU region. Every event organizer should 
 ensure their event is GDPR compliant to avoid 
 chances of being sued by either applicants or
 sponsors.
 
# Storage of Data

> Protect the data you store and only keep what you need.

When you customise the application, ensure that you 
only ask for data that you need to run your event 
successfully. This data should be protected and 
not shared with people who do not participate in 
ensuring the successful delivery of the workshop. 
Be sure to inform the applicants that you will 
share their phone numbers and/or email addresses
with their coaches. 

Coaches should not be given email addresses or 
phone numbers of attendees who are not in their 
group as they do not need to contact them before or 
after the workshop. Also inform  your coaches and organizers need to be informed that 
they should protect personal data of attendees and
other coaches/organizers and not share it amongst
themselves without the consent of the person(s).

# Subject Access Requests

> Make it easy to retrieve, delete and anonymise 
data when you need to.

Certain organisers, coaches or attendees may not 
want to be photographed or have their photos 
published. You should make sure you get consent
from all attendees to photograph them and publish
their photos before you do. Consent for 
photos is difficult to manage through an 
application form and is best done by using either
name tags or lanyards of different colours for 
"OK with photo" and "NOT OK with photo" attendees. 
The photographer has to make all efforts to avoid
all the "NOT OK with photo" attendees and should 
they be visible in a photo you want to publish,
you should have their faces blurred so that they 
cannot be recognised.


# Contacting Users

> Get fair consent before you communicate with users 
and maintain a preferences management. Get consent 
for photos before publishing them.

You also need to ensure that you get consent from 
the applicants via the application form to send 
them any mass email communication before, during 
and after the event. This consent should also 
cover their consent to be invited to other meet-ups
should you also want to suggest meet-ups they can
get involved with after the event. 

They should also be able to opt out of these 
communications anytime they wish to, therefore 
you should provide a link to unsubscribe from the
mass emails anytime a user wishes to do so. 
MailChimp already provides this, so if you are 
using MailChimp for your mass emails, you have 
this covered already.
 
# Profiling

> Users must be able to opt out of profiling.

Normally, there is no need for profiling 
attendees for Django Girls events in general. 
However, should you decide to profile your 
attendees, you should get consent from them and
they should be able to opt-out of profiling 
anytime they decide they are no longer 
interested. You should also make it clear during
 the application process that you may profile 
 them and ask for their consent in the application form.
